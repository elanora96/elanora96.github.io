## My personal site

This site is something between a fun project and a professional necessity

I plan on using it to push forward my hobbies and to advertise my developer expertise or something

Currently (2024-10-14)\* hosted on GH pages, this site is an SSR ready Vite powered Typescripted React Router routed MarkdownX'd smorgasbord of front end experience. I'm also rather proud of all the eslint, prettier, stylelint rules that are setup and checked at commit time. For once my personal site looks kind of like I know what I'm doing??

If you want to see what it's like to dev this page, I've provided a nix flake with a dev shell and all the dependencies needed
