This site is something between a fun project and a professional necessity

I plan on using it to push forward my hobbies and to advertise my developer expertise or something

Currently (2024-10-14)\*, hosted on GH pages, this site is an SSR ready Vite powered Typescripted React Router V7 routed MarkdownX'd smorgasbord of front end experience. I'm also rather proud of all the eslint, prettier, stylelint rules that are set up and checked at commit time. For once my personal site looks kind of like I know what I'm doing??

## Development

### Recommended (Nix Flake)

- Run `nix develop` to enter `devShells#default` from `flake.nix`
  - Enjoy everything NPM handled for you üòé‚ùÑÔ∏è
- Run `npm run dev` for a development server with HMR

### Manual

- Install dependencies as listed in `flake.nix` (just nodejs v23 for now, but if I forget to update the README check that)
- Run `npm install` to install node dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` for a development server with HMR
